Shortcuts and Hotkeys for daily work as a scrummaster or productowner (Autohotkey)

Some things are machine specific, so if U dont have the app or the path is wrong it will not work.

There is some work in progress in the files itself, so don't complain when code review about unfinished somethings.

This is more like "make my life easier" scripts than a one-function-one-goal app. So it's more aimed for the daily road warrior dealing with jira, G-Apps and such.
